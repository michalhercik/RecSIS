# RecSIS

## Description

RecSIS is a web application designed as an alternative to the subject page in SIS.
It provides a more efficient interface for searching and filtering university
courses and viewing detailed course information.

The system also introduces two new features:

- **Study Planning (Blueprint)**:
RecSIS allows users to organize their academic plans. Users can record courses
they have completed, are currently taking, or intend to take in the future. This
interface provides a clearer overview of a student's academic progress and supports
structured study planning across semesters and academic years.

- **Personalized Course Recommendations (Upcoming)**:
A key goal of the project is to provide personalized course recommendations based
on the studentâ€™s academic history and preferences. While this functionality is
still under development, the current system architecture and data model are
designed to support it.

RecSIS also includes degree plan visualization, allowing users to track their
progress toward completing it and easily add courses from the plan to their
blueprint. The system provides plenty of opportunities for further improvement,
development and research.

## Resources

- **Demo**: The best way to understand RecSIS is to try it yourself.  
  RecSIS is deployed at [acheron.ms.mff.cuni.cz:42050](https://acheron.ms.mff.cuni.cz:42050/).

- **User Guide**: If you don't like to explore RecSIS on your own or want to find not-so-obvious features, take a look at the  
  [User Guide](https://acheron.ms.mff.cuni.cz:42050/cs/help/cs.html).

- **Dev Guide**: The Dev Guide is a great place to learn how RecSIS works under the hood.  
  It helps you get RecSIS up and running in your local environment and explains the system's high-level architecture.  
  You can find it in our repository on [GitHub](docs/dev-guide.md).

- **Source Code**: The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/michalhercik/RecSIS/).
